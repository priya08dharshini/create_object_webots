creating object in webots:
1.go to wizards in webot and create a project name.
2. while opening select retangular arena 
3.you will get rectangular area in your desktop.
4. you can zoom in and out of the floor.
   i.mouse wheel= zoom
   ii.select object+left click= rotation
   iii.select object+right click= translation
5.left side you will see a scence tree.(each object is called node.
6. go to rectangular arena.then,lets create an object.
7.click rectangular arena and click the + sign in the top.(allows a new object)
8.you will get a new window,select base nodes in that solids
9.solid node is opened.then select that and go to children and add other shape.
10.within shape make other sphere,double click on geomentry lets again select the sphere.
11.under shape select apperence. click + or double click on geomentry
12.select base node PBR appereance and click on add.
13.under apperence we can change colour(red),and make roughnness=1 and metalness=0
14.thus,we created an object
 how to reuse the same shape:
1.click on shape DEF= ball (give some name)
2.on your boundary object under solid click + or double click
3.select use node (ball) and click add
4.under solid select physics ans double click
5.select physics and click add


recap:
creating an object
1.start with a solid node
2.add a child node to give it shape
3.use geomentry to choose the shape
4.add apperence and modify it
5.name the shape using DEF for reuse.
6.use DEF shape as bounding objects
7.add physics
